# Project Context — RubyxQube Site

## What This Is
A React + Vite marketing website for RubyxQube — Boyd's web design and AI agency for small businesses in the Treasure Valley (Boise, ID area). The site showcases services, pricing, and portfolio while proving design quality.

## Mobile-First Is Non-Negotiable

**Every page, every component, every change must be mobile responsive.**

RubyxQube sells mobile-first websites as its core product. The site IS the demo. If it looks broken on mobile, the pitch is dead.

Rules:
- Design for mobile screen first, then expand to tablet (720px) and desktop (860px)
- Use `.grid.cols-2` and `.grid.cols-3` — these are already responsive via the CSS breakpoints
- Never use fixed pixel widths on containers — use `max-width` + `width: 100%`
- `padding` on `.section` and `.heroSection` already collapses on mobile — use those classes
- Test mentally: "Does this stack vertically on a 390px screen?"
- Inline grid styles must include `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(...))` or responsive column counts
- `flexWrap: "wrap"` on any `display: flex` row that contains multiple elements

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** React 18 + React Router v6
- **Build tool:** Vite 5
- **Styling:** Custom CSS in `src/styles.css` — **no Tailwind** in this project
- **Icons:** Lucide React — standard on all projects. No emojis as UI icons. Use `color="var(--accent)"` for feature icons, `color="var(--muted)"` for utility icons (close, arrows). Size 24–26px for cards, 16px inline.
- **Never use Unicode arrows** (↗ → ← etc.) as button or link decorators — on macOS/iOS they render as colored emoji. Use Lucide `ExternalLink` (size 13–14, `style={{ marginLeft: 6, verticalAlign: "middle" }}`) for external link buttons. Plain text only for nav/footer links — no arrow character needed.
- **Font:** Plus Jakarta Sans (Google Fonts, loaded in `index.html`)
- **Assets:** Logos in `src/assets/`, favicon in `public/`

## Image Best Practices (applies to every project)

Every image used on any site — RubyxQube or client — must follow these rules. The builder agent should apply these automatically without being asked.

**Format**
- Always use WebP. Run `node scripts/optimize-images.mjs` to batch convert from jpg/png.
- Exception: SVG for logos and icons, PNG only if transparency is needed and WebP doesn't support the use case.

**Loading**
- Hero image (above the fold, LCP candidate): `loading="eager" fetchpriority="high"`
- Everything else: `loading="lazy"`
- Never omit the `loading` attribute.

**Dimensions**
- Always set explicit `width` and `height` attributes — prevents layout shift (CLS).
- Use `style={{ aspectRatio: "16/9" }}` or equivalent CSS to reserve space before the image loads.

**Alt text**
- Every `<img>` must have a descriptive `alt` attribute.
- Decorative images (icons, backgrounds): `alt=""`
- Content images: describe what's in the image concisely.

**File size targets**
- Hero / large feature image: < 200KB
- Gallery / card images: < 100KB
- Thumbnails: < 50KB
- Videos: compress with ffmpeg (`-crf 28`) or HandBrake before placing in `public/videos/`

**Responsive**
- Never use fixed pixel widths on images — use `width: 100%` with a max-width container.
- For art-directed images (different crop on mobile), use `<picture>` with `<source media="...">`.

**Quick audit checklist before shipping any page:**
- [ ] All images are WebP
- [ ] Hero has `loading="eager" fetchpriority="high"`
- [ ] All other images have `loading="lazy"`
- [ ] All images have `width`, `height`, and `alt`
- [ ] File sizes are within targets

## Video Best Practices (applies to every project)

**Format & compression**
- MP4 (H.264) for universal support — this is the default output from ffmpeg and HandBrake
- Compress before placing in `public/videos/`: `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vcodec libx264 -crf 28 -preset slow -movflags +faststart output.mp4`
- `-movflags +faststart` is critical — moves metadata to the front so the video starts playing before fully downloaded
- File size targets: background/hero video < 5MB, gallery/featured video < 20MB

**Loading**
- `preload="none"` on all videos below the fold — don't load until the user interacts
- `preload="metadata"` on hero/featured videos — loads dimensions and duration only
- Always set a `poster` attribute (WebP image) — prevents a blank black box on load
- For gallery videos: load only when visible using IntersectionObserver, or use `preload="none"`

**Autoplay rules**
- Background/ambient video: `autoplay muted loop playsinline` — all four attributes required or browsers will block it
- Never autoplay with sound — browsers block it and users hate it
- Featured/gallery videos: user-initiated play only, with `controls`

**Accessibility**
- Always include `<track kind="captions">` for any video with speech (WCAG requirement)
- For purely visual/ambient videos: `aria-hidden="true"` is sufficient

**Quick audit checklist for videos:**
- [ ] MP4 compressed with `-crf 28 -movflags +faststart`
- [ ] File size within targets
- [ ] `poster` attribute set (WebP)
- [ ] `preload="none"` unless hero/featured
- [ ] Autoplay only if `muted loop playsinline` are all present
- [ ] `controls` on any user-facing video player
- [ ] Captions for any video with speech

## Audio Best Practices

**Format:** MP3 for universal support. AAC (`.m4a`) for better compression if targeting modern browsers only.

**Loading:** Always `preload="none"` — never load audio until the user explicitly requests it.

**Autoplay:** Never. No exceptions. Browsers block it, users are startled by it, and it's an accessibility violation.

**Controls:** Always provide visible controls or a custom UI. Never hide the fact that audio exists on a page.

**Quick audit checklist for audio:**
- [ ] `preload="none"` on all `<audio>` elements
- [ ] No autoplay
- [ ] Visible controls or custom UI
- [ ] Text description of audio content for accessibility

## Design Direction
**Dark, sleek, ruby red** — professional, modern, high-contrast for tech-forward service businesses.

### Dark theme (default — `:root`)

| Token | Value |
|-------|-------|
| `--bg` | `#080808` (near black) |
| `--text` | `rgba(255,255,255,0.90)` |
| `--muted` | `rgba(255,255,255,0.48)` |
| `--accent` | `#e11d48` (ruby red — primary CTA, badges, highlights) |
| `--accent-hover` | `#c0112f` |
| `--accent-dim` | `rgba(225,29,72,0.10)` |
| Font | Plus Jakarta Sans, weights 400–800 |

### Light theme (`[data-theme="light"]`)

| Token | Value |
|-------|-------|
| `--bg` | `#F5F0EA` (warm cream) |
| `--text` | `rgba(20,12,15,0.90)` — ~13:1 contrast ✓ |
| `--muted` | `rgba(20,12,15,0.65)` — ~5.2:1 contrast, WCAG AA ✓ |
| `--line` | `rgba(20,12,15,0.10)` |
| Accent | Same ruby red — works on both themes |

**Default theme is light.** Users who prefer dark can toggle; their choice persists in localStorage.

**Navbar and Footer stay dark in both themes.** Their backgrounds are hardcoded dark rgba — no overrides needed. This means the logo never needs a dark/light variant in the nav.

## Light/Dark Mode Architecture

Every site we build gets this by default.

### Hook
`src/hooks/useTheme.js` — copy verbatim to every client project.
- Reads/writes `localStorage['color-scheme']`
- Falls back to `prefers-color-scheme`
- Sets `data-theme` attribute on `<html>`

### Anti-flash script
Must be the **first thing in `<head>`**, before any stylesheet:
```html
<script>
  (function(){
    try{
      var s=localStorage.getItem('color-scheme');
      if(s==='light'||s==='dark'){document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme',s);return;}
    }catch(e){}
    document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme',
      window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: light)').matches?'light':'dark');
  })();
</script>
```

### Layout wiring
```jsx
// Layout.jsx
const { theme, toggle } = useTheme();
// MeshGradient only in dark mode:
{theme === "dark" && <MeshGradient ... />}
// Pass to Navbar:
<Navbar theme={theme} onToggle={toggle} />
```

### Navbar toggle
- Desktop: icon button at end of `.navLinks` row
- Mobile: labeled row at bottom of `.mobileMenu` drawer
- Always dark context — no theme-adaptive styles needed on the button

### CSS pattern
Two blocks in `src/styles.css`:
1. `:root` — dark defaults (current)
2. `[data-theme="light"]` — warm cream overrides

Components use CSS variables; the only hardcoded overrides needed are:
- `.card` background (rgba white vs white/80)
- `.surface` background (near-invisible white vs near-invisible dark)
- `.input / select / textarea` backgrounds and text colors
- `::placeholder` and `label` colors

## Contrast Requirements (WCAG AA minimum)

**Never ship text that fails 4.5:1 contrast on its background.**

| Context | Minimum ratio | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| Body text (`--text`) | 7:1+ | Always high contrast |
| Secondary text (`--muted`) | 4.5:1 | WCAG AA for normal text |
| Placeholder text | 3:1 | WCAG AA for UI components |
| Accent on dark bg | ✓ | `#e11d48` on `#080808` = 4.6:1 |
| Accent on cream bg | ✓ | `#e11d48` on `#F5F0EA` = 4.8:1 |

**In light mode, do not use `rgba(white)` for text** — it will fail. Use `rgba(20,12,15, X)` scaled by opacity.

## Key Files
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/siteConfig.js` | Brand name, email, phone, service area — single source of truth |
| `src/styles.css` | Entire design system; all shared styles live here |
| `src/App.jsx` | Route definitions |
| `src/components/Layout.jsx` | Wraps every page with Navbar + Footer |
| `vercel.json` | Rewrites for SPA routing + toolbar disabled (see below) |

## vercel.json Standard

Every project ships with this exact `vercel.json` — no exceptions:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/((?!.*\\.).*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

Note: `toolbar` was removed — Vercel CLI v54+ rejects it as an invalid property and blocks all deployments. The toolbar can be disabled in the Vercel project dashboard under Settings → General if needed.

## Style Conventions
- All styles go in `src/styles.css` — avoid `<style>` blocks or inline styles
- Use existing CSS variables — don't hardcode colors
- Use existing semantic class names (`.card`, `.surface`, `.btn`, `.grid`, `.badge`) — don't invent new ones unless necessary
- Breakpoints: `@media (min-width: 720px)` (tablet), `@media (min-width: 860px)` (desktop)
- Amber accent for interactive states (active nav, focus ring, primary button, selected card)

## Component Conventions
- Pages → `src/pages/`, shared UI → `src/components/`
- Use `siteConfig` for any brand/contact info — **never** hardcode phone or email in components
- React Router `<Link>` for internal nav; plain `<a>` for external links, `tel:`, and `mailto:`

## SEO — Non-Negotiable on Every Page

**This is what we sell. Every client site must be set before launch.**

For each page, set in the `<head>` (use React Helmet or a `<Helmet>` wrapper component):
- `<title>` — unique per page. Format: "Service | Business Name | City, ST"
- `<meta name="description">` — unique per page, 120–155 chars, local keyword + CTA
- `<meta property="og:title">`, `og:description`, `og:image`, `og:url` — used by social/link previews
- `<link rel="canonical">` — prevents duplicate content signals

On the Home page only, add a LocalBusiness JSON-LD schema block:
```jsx
<script type="application/ld+json">{JSON.stringify({
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "LocalBusiness",
  "name": siteConfig.businessName,
  "url": siteConfig.siteUrl,
  "telephone": siteConfig.phone,
  "address": { "@type": "PostalAddress", "addressLocality": "Boise", "addressRegion": "ID" },
  "openingHours": "Mo-Fr 08:00-18:00",
  "areaServed": siteConfig.serviceArea
})}</script>
```

All images must have descriptive `alt` text. Decorative images: `alt=""`.

Do not skip SEO for any page, even simple ones. The builder agent must set these before calling any build done.

## Contact Form Standard (Resend — No Formspree)

**Every site ships with a working contact form. Never use Formspree.**

Contact form endpoint: `/api/contact.js` — a Vercel serverless function that sends via Resend.

Required behavior:
- POSTs to `/api/contact` from the React form component
- Sends an email to `process.env.ALERT_EMAIL` via `RESEND_API_KEY`
- Sets `reply_to` to the visitor's email address so Boyd can reply directly
- Returns `{ ok: true }` on success, `{ ok: false, error }` on failure
- Form shows an inline success message — no page redirect, no Formspree URL in the browser

Env vars needed (same ones used for chatbot alerts — already set per client):
- `RESEND_API_KEY`
- `ALERT_EMAIL`

The builder must send a real test submission and confirm the email arrives before marking any site as complete.

## What NOT to Change Without Asking
- Pricing amounts (Pricing.jsx, Home.jsx)
- Route paths in App.jsx (renaming breaks inbound links)
- Brand name or contact info — update `siteConfig.js` instead
